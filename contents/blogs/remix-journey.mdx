## My Journey

I started designing and developing my own website way back in 2016 with no code solution like Webflow. I was
very excited about the endless possibilities of what I can achieve with the solution but as time goes by, I started
to stumble into multiple issues/roadblocks etc and it was quite expensive to integrate with third-party APIs
and even connecting a domain name that I purchased somewhere else for a much cheaper price to Webflow back in the
days were quite expensive given I'm still a student living with my mum's money.

Eventho Webflow and similar no-code solution has come a long way, I still wanted to experience that good feeling when you build
something on your own.

My journey in programming is kind of on and off prior to 2019. My first ever recorded programming journey started
way back in 2012 by watching a Python programming tutorial on thenewboston channel. Learning javascript, HTML, and CSS
in 2016 and for some reason, I stopped probably because of my degree choice in Advertising Design. It was tiring and
most dreadful years of my life. I took this degree because it a cheaper than a computer science degree which I could not afford.
At the end of my final uni year, I realize that I only love high-level design thinking and research in creating pretty but
functional designs but not designing some posters which is the expected career path for someone with my degree and the pay was
abysmal at best especially in the South East Asia region.

Troubled over my own uncertain future, I restarted my programming journey in 2019 (because we all know working in tech is where the money at)
with a new passion for learning and building things hoping to redirect my future to something, I might enjoy and have a livable income.

## CS50 by David J. Malan from Harvard is a game-changer

Finding well-structured courses that teach you strong fundamentals is tough. It's like searching for a needle in a hack stack.
Yes, there are plenty of tutorials, and courses out there, but not everyone can teach. CS50 is phenomenal and it was one of the best
courses I've ever taken Dr. David J. Malan is a very entertaining and engaging teacher even tho it is an online course. If anyone
asks me where to start and learn to program, I would definitely recommend CS50. It teaches you the fundamentals of programming and a
Lil bit of C, Python, and Javascript. This is also where I first started learning my first web framework called Django.
